<objective>
Orchestrate the complete Ralph autonomous agent pipeline for feature development.

This skill coordinates: spec-interview → generate-prd → ralph-convert-prd → subagent execution, keeping you in control at each decision point while enabling autonomous implementation through ralph-coder and ralph-tester subagents.
</objective>

<context>
User request: $ARGUMENTS

Current state:
- prd.json exists: !`[ -f tasks/prd.json ] && echo "YES" || echo "NO"`
- Story status: !`cat tasks/prd.json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '(.userStories | length) as $total | ([.userStories[] | select(.status == "done")] | length) as $done | "\($done)/\($total) stories complete"' 2>/dev/null || echo "No prd.json"`
</context>

<routing>
Based on $ARGUMENTS, route to the appropriate workflow:

| Argument | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "status", "check", "progress" | Check current prd.json status and suggest next steps |
| "continue", "from-prd" | Convert existing PRD to prd.json and execute |
| "execute", "run" | Run subagent loop on existing prd.json |
| Feature description or empty | Start full pipeline (spec → PRD → prd.json → execute) |
</routing>

<process>
1. Invoke the ralph-orchestrator skill
2. Present the intake menu if no clear routing from arguments
3. Follow the selected workflow exactly
4. Pause at each user checkpoint for approval
5. For execution, spawn ralph-coder/ralph-tester subagents via Agent tool with parallel batch execution
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Correct workflow selected based on user intent
- User approves at each checkpoint (spec, PRD, prd.json)
- All stories reach `status: "done"`
- Code committed and quality checks passing
</success_criteria>
